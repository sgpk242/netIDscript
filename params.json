{"name":"Netidscript","tagline":"A script to retrieve netID's from Notre Dame's Directory online application from last names.","body":"### Welcome to My Bookmarklet Page.\r\nI was experimenting with bookmarklets for a while when I had a university project to locate the user IDs of faculty so that they could be entered for a department election. The only way to find the user ID was by entering the faculty member's name into my university's online directory form - only one name could be submitted at a time. To expedite the process of locating over 200 faculty member's IDs, I decided to look into bookmarklets. \r\n\r\nThis text would be entered into the URL of the bookmarklet:\r\n\r\n    javascript:(function(){   \r\n       document.body.appendChild(\r\n       document.createElement('script')).src=\r\n       'http://sgpk242.github.io/netIDscript/final.js';\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nI used an 'alert' function to test this (code [here](http://sgpk242.github.io/netIDscript/test.js)). Final.js can be found [here](http://sgpk242.github.io/netIDscript/final.js).\r\n\r\nAlthough I found them to be a really interesting tool, I decided to stop pursuing this project when I learned that the Content Security Policy (2015) prevented me from using jQuery and my files hosted on this site in my bookmarklets on other sites.\r\n\r\nDecember 24, 2015\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
