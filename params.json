The only way to find the user ID was by entering the faculty member's name into my university's online directory form - only one name could be submitted at a time. To expedite the process of locating over 200 faculty member's IDs, I decided to look into bookmarklets. Although I found them to be a really interesting tool, I decided to stop pursuing this project when I learned that the Content Security Policy (2015) prevented me from using jQuery and my files hosted on this site in my bookmarklets on other sites.\r\n\r\nDecember 24, 2015\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
